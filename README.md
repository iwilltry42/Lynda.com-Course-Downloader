# Lynda.com Course Downloader

At the time of writing this script, Lynda.com offered no way of downloading all the videos for a whole course at once.
The script runs from terminal and lets you login to Lynda.com, select a course and start downloading all the course-videos 
in a single run and renames them properly.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x (with pip)
- install packages via `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

Start simply by running `python3 lynda_loader.py` and the program will ask you to put in your credentials for login.

## Note

This is quite an old project which surely does not follow any best practices or style guides... sorry for that, maybe I'll fix that at some point in the future...
