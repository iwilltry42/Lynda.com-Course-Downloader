# Lynda.com Course Downloader #

At the time of writing this script, Lynda.com offered no way of downloading all the videos for a whole course at once.
The script runs from terminal and lets you login to Lynda.com, select a course and start downloading all the course-videos 
in a single run and renames them properly.
