Lynda.com Course Downloader

At the time of writing this Python file, Lynda.com offered no way of downloading all the videos for a whole course.
So this Python project can be run from command line and lets you login to Lynda.com, select a course and start downloading all the course-videos 
in a single run and renames them properly.
